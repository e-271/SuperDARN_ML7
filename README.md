# SuperDARN_ML7

This is the project page of Machine Learning Group 7's SuperDARN project. Our objective is to classify backscatter data as ground scatter or ionospheric scatter using machine learning algorithms.

How to Run:
* Download the SAS.db database, and place in the Data folder. (Note, SAS.db is too big for Github)
* Install dependencies:
	davitpy
	sklearn
	ipdb
	matplotlib
	scipy
	numpy
* Navigate to the GMM or Kmeans folder, and run the scripts. File path to the database looks in "../Data/", so make sure you are in the subdirectory GMM or Kmeans.
